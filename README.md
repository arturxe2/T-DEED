## Overview

This repository contains the code for T-DEED: Temporal-Discriminability Enhancer Encoder-Decoder for Precise Event Spotting. It builds upon the codebase from [E2E-Spot](https://github.com/jhong93/spot), and we extend our gratitude for their work.

## Environment

You can install the required packages for the project using the following command, with `requirements.txt` specifying the versions of the various packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Refer to the README files in the [data](/data/) directory for pre-processing and setup instructions. 


## Execution

The `train_tdeed.py` file is designed to train and evaluate T-DEED based on the settings specified in the chosen configuration file. You can execute the file using the following command:

```
python3 train_tdeed.py --model <model_name>
```

Here, `<model_name>` follows the format `<dataset>_<name>`, where `<dataset>` is one of the three possible datasets (FigureSkatingComp, FigureSkatingPerf, or FineDiving), and `<name>` can be chosen freely but must match the name specified in the configuration file located in the config directory.

For example, to use the FineDiving dataset with the small model (200MF), you would run:

```
python3 train_tdeed.py --model FineDiving_small
```

You can control whether to train the whole model or just evaluate it using the `only_test` parameter in the configuration file. For additional details on configuration options, refer to the README in the [config](/config/) directory.

## Trained models

Model checkpoints can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sxZalU_hCwL8ITZCU9VqSWE8dB94lJty?usp=drive_link), and configurations are available in the [config](/config/) directory. To use the checkpoints, place the checkpoint file in the [checkpoints](/checkpoints/) directory, maintaining the same structure as shown with `FineDiving_small`.

*There has been a slight improvement in the results of some datasets compared to those reported in the paper.\
**Note: Some results may slightly vary from those reported in the paper, as the paper's results are the average of two executions with different seeds, while here we only include one of the model's checkpoints.
